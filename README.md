# Battery:
A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy. This process occurs through an electrochemical reaction within the batteryâ€™s cells, which consist of two electrodes (anode and cathode) and an electrolyte and a separator.
# Types of batteries.
primary battery and secondary battery among these 2 we are mainly focused on the secondary battery;
# Secondary batteries:
Secondary batteries, also known as rechargeable batteries, are designed to be used multiple times. They can be recharged by applying an external electrical current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge viseversa.
# Types of secondary batteries:
there are different types of sodium ion batteries among the the most widely used battery is lithium ion battery.
so now are mainly focused on the sodium ion batteries 
# Sodium ion battery
Sodium-ion batteries (Na-ion batteries) are a type of rechargeable battery that uses sodium ions as the charge carriers
* Abundance: Sodium is more abundant and less expensive than lithium, making these batteries potentially cheaper to produce.
* Working Principle: They operate similarly to lithium-ion batteries, with sodium ions moving between the anode and cathode through an electrolyte during charge and discharge cycles2.
* Applications: Currently being explored for large-scale energy storage solutions due to their cost-effectiveness.
# Separator
* The separator plays the pivotal role in normal lithium ion batteries and Sodium ion batteries and there is a close relationship between separator and battery safety. The separator acts as a physical barrier to insulate cathode and anode from direct contact and accommodate electrolyte to facilitate ions shuttle inside the battery.
* The importance of separators is self-evident, separator failure would pose serious risk to battery.
# Electrospinning method.
* Electrospinning is a versatile technique for fabricating polymeric nanofibers (synthetic and natural) via electrostatic forces with a diameter range from 2 nm to few micrometres.
* we used the electrospinning method for fabricating separators.
* electrospinning depends on the 4 parameters they are 1.votlage, 2.flow rate, 3.tip to collector distance, 4.concentration of the polynomial. By considering all these parameters we are preparing a better separator.
# Selection of material for polymer solution 
* We have some requirements based on those requirements we opted for these matterials 
* PAN - Polyacrylonitrile - Polynomial.
* HNT - Halloysite Nanotubes - Filler.
A composite separator electrolyte(PAN/HNT) system to use in SIBs through the electrospinning processes.
so we fabricated a separator with parameters as 1.Voltage -12v,2.Flow rate- 2ml/hr,3.Tip to collector distance-14cm,4.concentration-10%.
test the physical, morphological, and electrochemical performance of the fabricated separator.
we performed the Potentiostatic EIS test to calculate the resistance of the separator after using a formula we calculated it's ionic conductivity and by performing chronoampheremetry we calculated the tranceference number of the separator and by perfroming the linear sweep voltametry we calculated the volatge and using a formula we calculated the porocoty of the separator.
* after performing all these test a composite PAN/HNT separator gave goood results.
