# Battery:
A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy. This process occurs through an electrochemical reaction within the batteryâ€™s cells, which consist of two electrodes (anode and cathode) and an electrolyte and a separator.
# Types of batteries.
primary battery and secondary battery among these 2 we are mainly focused on the secondary battery;
# Secondary batteries:
Secondary batteries, also known as rechargeable batteries, are designed to be used multiple times. They can be recharged by applying an external electrical current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge viseversa.
# Types of secondary batteries:
there are different types of sodium ion batteries among the the most widely used battery is lithium ion battery.
so now are mainly focused on the sodium ion batteries 
# Sodium ion battery
Sodium-ion batteries (Na-ion batteries) are a type of rechargeable battery that uses sodium ions as the charge carriers
Abundance: Sodium is more abundant and less expensive than lithium, making these batteries potentially cheaper to produce1.
Working Principle: They operate similarly to lithium-ion batteries, with sodium ions moving between the anode and cathode through an electrolyte during charge and discharge cycles2.
Applications: Currently being explored for large-scale energy storage solutions due to their cost-effectiveness
